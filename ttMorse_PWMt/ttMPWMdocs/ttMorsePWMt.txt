ttMorsePWMt.txt - use table-lookup for rise/fall shape of PWM waveform

ttmDesign.txt and ttMorsePWM.txt

Instead of the linear ramp rise/fall of ttMorsePWM, this version assumes
the shape of the rise/fall will be stored in a table which has the following
characteristics:
 - 256 bytes long
 - Range of entries is 0..255; 0 corresponds to zero output from PWM
   generator, 255 corresponds to max output from PWM generator (+/- 127)
 - The beginning entries of the table correspond to the start of the rise
   (so should be zero or close to it) and the end of the table corresponds
   to the end of the rise time. When the program generates the fall time,
   the table is read in the SAME order, but the value used for the gain is
   255-tablevalue. This behaviour is necessary for the case of rise/fall
   waveforms that are not symmetrical about the mid-amplitude point--such as
   the exponential shape.
 - The 'rise time' is defined to be the time it takes the (16-bit) amplitude 
   accumulation to reach all the way through the table. This (arbitrary)
   definition is to make the rise time definition similar to the linear
   ramp rise/fall definition in ttMorse_PWM.
 - The risetime table is stored in a file named luTab.h located in the
   library folder ttMorse_PWMt (along with the .cpp and other .h files).
   See the file luTab.h for the details of the necessary format for this
   header file to be included correctly by the arduino compilation.

Some look-up tables are included with this documentation: exp2Tab.h, 
linTab.h, cosTab.h and cubTab.h. To use these tables (or any other created
to conform as described above), move the table (or a copy) out of the docs
folder to be with the library files (.cpp, .h, keywords), then rename the
rise/fall table file to luTab.h and rebuild your sketch with the 
ttMorse_PWMt library. You probably have to exit the arduino environment and
restart it for the changes in the library files structure to be noticed.

The exponential table has been constructed with values corresponding to 4
time constants (plus a little fiddling at the end). Consequently if you want
the Morse elements to have a particular tau (time constant), then you need
to specify 4 times that value in the object constructor. For example, to
have the waveform rise to 63% of its max value within 5 msec, you specify
the risetime in the constructor to be 20.

The cubTab.h table is based on the function y = 3*x*x - 2*x*x*x on the 
interval 0..1. This function has zero slope at x=0 and at x=1 and amplitude
1 at x=1. Thanks Ben.
